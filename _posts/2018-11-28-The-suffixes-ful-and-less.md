We can add -ful or -less to some nouns to form adjectives. The suffix -ful means "full of". The suffix -less means "without".

|Noun|Adjective (with -ful)|Adjective (with -less)|
|:-----|:------|:--------|
|care  |careful|careless |
|help  |helpful|helpless |
|use   |useful |useless  |

*Not all words have both -ful and -less as suffices
[ **F** ]noise**ful**
[ **T** ]noise**less**
