We start a sentence with the base form of a verb when we want to tell people what to do.
*e.g. put up a picture on the wall.*
 *paint the walls blue.*
We add do not/don't in front of a verb when we want to tell people not to do something
*e.g. Don't paint the cat.*
We often add please in a sentence to make an instruction more polite.
*e.g. Please fix the shelf for me.*
 *Don't touch the wet paint, please.*
