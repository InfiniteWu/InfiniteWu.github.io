We use **should** and **had better** when giving advice and telling people what we think is the best or right thing to do. 
The tone of had better is stronger than should.

*e.g. you should know a little about DIY.*

*You should not put so many books on the shelf.*

*Your watch is broken. You had better buy a new one.*

*You had better not be late for school.*
