We can compare the amount of things using **more...than, fewer...than** and **less...than**. We use **the most** for the largest amount and **the fewest/the least** for the smallest amount.
*We use **fewer** and **the fewest** with countable nouns, We use **more** and **the most** with both countable and uncountable nouns.
